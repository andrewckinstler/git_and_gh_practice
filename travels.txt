A few years ago I got to go to Hawaii with my extended family. This was a hard trip because my Grandmother was dying of brain cancer, but we took that as an opportunity to have a good of a time as we possibly could. We found every bit of interesting food we could find (Spam musubi is incredible!), and tried to have as many experiences as we could, the most notable for me being deep sea fishing.
